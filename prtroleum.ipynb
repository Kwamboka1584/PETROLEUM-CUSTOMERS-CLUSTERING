    "\n",
    "Sicah Energies LTD is a petroleum products dealer that serves a diverse range of customers — from individual motorists and small businesses to large commercial clients. Each customer segment demonstrates unique purchasing behaviors such as fueling frequency, preferred fuel type, payment methods, and spending levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an increasingly competitive petroleum market, understanding customer behavior is essential for maintaining loyalty and improving profitability. Applying uniform marketing, pricing, and loyalty strategies across all customers often leads to inefficiencies and lost opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to **analyze and segment Sicah Energies LTD’s customers** based on their purchasing and behavioral characteristics. Through data-driven insights, the company aims to enhance its marketing strategies, strengthen customer relationships, and improve overall business performance.\n"
