    "#  Petroleum Customer Clustering Project — Sicah Energies LTD\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Sicah Energies LTD is a petroleum products dealer that serves a diverse range of customers — from individual motorists and small businesses to large commercial clients. Each customer segment demonstrates unique purchasing behaviors such as fueling frequency, preferred fuel type, payment methods, and spending levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an increasingly competitive petroleum market, understanding customer behavior is essential for maintaining loyalty and improving profitability. Applying uniform marketing, pricing, and loyalty strategies across all customers often leads to inefficiencies and lost opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to **analyze and segment Sicah Energies LTD’s customers** based on their purchasing and behavioral characteristics. Through data-driven insights, the company aims to enhance its marketing strategies, strengthen customer relationships, and improve overall business performance.\n"

    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Sicah Energies LTD currently lacks a clear understanding of the various customer groups it serves. Without data-driven segmentation, all customers are treated uniformly when designing loyalty programs, promotional campaigns, and service packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalized approach has led to:\n",
    "- Missed opportunities for targeted marketing,\n",
    "- Inefficient allocation of marketing resources,\n",
    "- Poor understanding of customer churn risks and demand variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, this project will apply **unsupervised machine learning (clustering)** to group customers with similar characteristics and purchasing patterns. These insights will enable the company to design tailored marketing initiatives, improve loyalty programs, and optimize operational decisions.\n"

    "## 4. Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be evaluated based on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The clustering model should identify **distinct and interpretable customer groups**.  \n",
    "- Each identified cluster should display clear differences in behavior, such as spending habits, frequency of visits, or fuel type preferences.  \n",
    "- The insights generated should support **data-driven decision-making** at Sicah Energies LTD, enabling personalized marketing, customer retention, and increased profitability.\n"
